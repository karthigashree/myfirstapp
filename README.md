How do i do this..here some easy steps to follow to put a code in github..
           First create an account in github by
           
           https://github.com 
           
and login and go to your page . On the right bottom we have an option new repository open it…
Then, add repository name (testing)

    Give some  discription of your project 
    Choose public
    And click intialize this repository by README
    Then create repository

Create new folder (rails)in  your desktop(or any where)
     Then open terminal and change the curent directory to desktop by 
              
              cd desktop
    
       Inside this move to a folder what you created initially 
              
              cd rails….
     
       Then type 
     
              git clone https://github.com/username/foldername.git(eg.git clone https://github.com/karthigashree/testing.git)  
              
              
it  just copy the readme file what you are created in github to your  testing folder(created in your desktop)…
    Now inside the rails folder you see testing
    cd testing (new repository created in your github page)
   Then create any ruby file and save in your folder…
Then do the following command
    git status
           By doing this you see what the files you are added  
    git add filename.rb
            By this we just add the file in your folder
            
    git status
            By this you added the file and you see
    git commit –m “any text”
   git push origin master
            Now open your github page just refresh it  your ruby file is added like this…..
